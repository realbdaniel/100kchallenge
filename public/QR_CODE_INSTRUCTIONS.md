# QR Code Instructions

## Replace the placeholder QR code

The file `public/venmo-qr.png` currently contains a placeholder. 

**To complete the setup:**

1. Save your Venmo QR code image as `venmo-qr.png`
2. Replace the placeholder file at `public/venmo-qr.png` with your actual QR code image
3. The QR code should be a square image (recommended: 200x200px or larger)

## What's been implemented:

✅ Replaced "Upgrade to Builder PRO" section with "Support the Project"  
✅ Added donation modal with support messaging  
✅ Included gamification and analytics improvement mentions  
✅ Added Venmo link: https://venmo.com/u/benjamin-daniel-1  
✅ Added QR code display area
